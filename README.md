### Why Hephaestus
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire and metalworking, and software developers share a common thread in their dedication to their crafts and their use of specialized tools. Hephaestus, renowned for his skill in creating legendary artifacts like Achilles' shield and Heracles' armor, wielded hammers and anvils to forge his creations despite personal challenges. Similarly, software developers employ programming languages and development environments to build and refine digital products. Both face unique challengesâ€”Hephaestus contended with physical impairments and rejection, while developers tackle complex coding problems and evolving requirements. Despite their different mediums, both are recognized for their expertise and the significant impact of their creations on their respective worlds.</p>
